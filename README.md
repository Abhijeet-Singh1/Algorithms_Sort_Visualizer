# Algorithms_Sort_Visualizer

 1. Created a compelling React web application that provides users with an interactive and intuitive visualization of various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc. in action. 
 2. The application utilizes column graphs (via Google Charts) to represent arrays of numbers, and leverages set timeouts, await, and promise functions to create a visually engaging animation effect.
